* irradiated allogeneic PBMC
  * feeder PBMC provide factors that help T cell grow, like IL-2
  * induce T cell proliferation due to HLA mismatch
  * irradiated so will die after some days, without contaminating your culture after expansion

* MHC
  * MHC I: alpha chain (45kD, extracellular, TM, and CT) + beta-2 microglobulin (12kD), express on most somatic cells
  * MHC II: alpha chain (33kD) + beta chain (28kD), express on B cells and dendritic cells APC
